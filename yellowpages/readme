Yellow Pages

Creating a distributed landscape description of objects, which can be part in a Kafka environment. 

The goal is to manage logical objects in one common place within a cluster in a cload with a process calculus background. 
We basically follow the Actor model and define objects as logical, business defined "actors" in business processes. 
An actor on that level is an order, a delivery note, a bill-of-material or others.

THe goal is to limit limit the amount of Kafka topics in a distributed landscape to not a so big number even for a whole company, 
but should also allow to have read access via HTTP to the same objects via TCP/IP. By this we also define and limit the amount of message queues and recipients.

Since then we have a limited amount of queues, we also have a defined statial coordinate system in the cloud. It allows defining more than just the logical classes
of the available objects, but also defining a statial and a timely coordinate system of the instances of the objects, but of the object identities, but also of their 
timely order.t

THe assumption is that we can define a spatial and timely oordinate system for objects by doing this. Here the actor name can define some kind of a 
spatial coordinate (since every actor at a given point in time needs to have one valid master location. 
This instance acts as the transactional master. 

On the other side this object then can also manage a version number as a timely coordinate on itself. 
Taking this together we can reach a Vector Time representatation of objects in a cloud. 

Vector Clock is a general way do manage a distributed time coordinate (it was invented mostly by Calin Fidge and Friedemann Mattern). It allows having a full
spatial and timely map of all results.

So it is about yellow pages of classes and objects organized both in space and time.

Since we will need for every actor two sequence numbers to be genrated into a landscape of a cluster,
we use mustache/handlebar to define the nodes in the distributed landscape of a clster postgreSQL instances (or actually other distributed database clusters.

The yellow pages implementation then acts at minimum as a "control plane" for the cluster, 
but it can also be a schema inside a distributed cluster of PostgreSQL instances.

The basic goal is define a causal map between logical objects ("actors" ) and their timey relations of versions - similiar as with a Vector Clock implementation.

Versions are defined by CREATTE, INSERT NEW VERSION and CANCEL operations on the object instances, which belong to the same "Actor".

The environment needs to generate a list of database instances and or schemata, but also of fail-over instances with predined replication schemes.

This needs to include applicatioon servers, which act basically as proxy servers connecting to the databases and Kafka topics all together in a consistent landscape picture. This is very close to 
Teraform, but with a very string focus on providing a product landscape (in a Kubernetes cluster).

Rational: 
we need to have a bootstrap anvironment, where we can edit a basic landscape manually using JSON. This cannot be the final environment. In the end the production of a 
cloud landscape has a lot of similarities then of the production of material goods. But we need a base idea of a cloud landscape, before we go produce a 
general material management environment. In the end a material catalog and the description of the container instances in a lean-development cloud are very similar. In the end we want to develop the landscape  also 
to have a more general concept.
