Export function.

We need a function, which allows collecting the information build up in a workflow, consolidate this (that is adding up CRUD operations), 
add key mapping if needed and produce a Kafka message, which is representign the outcome of a workflow as a whole, basically a closing document - to be send to a Kafka topic, which represents a logical "actor".

A logical actor is typically a business document, which describes an achieved task and which is final. This in most cases is a "busines record" ("Beleg") or actually any result, 
which was achieved as a whole. 

So basically we have two similar data structures, one is the collection of intends in a workflow, the other one is the (immutable) record of the result. 

We can do this best by assuming that this function is a template function, where the data structures A1, A2, A3 ...  of a single row translates into a collection 
of tablestable with a given key range (the key is the key of the actor!). Examples are orders, delivery notes, but also processes around master data like materials, 
products, catalogs of materials or products, but also of plans about doing something (like a sales plan or a production plan etc.).

TEchnically this is a process, which we may want to call "Sense Making" - just to give it a context.
